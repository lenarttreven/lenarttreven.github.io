I am part of [LAS Group](https://las.inf.ethz.ch/) at [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/en.html). During my PhD I was advised by [Andreas Krause](https://las.inf.ethz.ch/krausea) and [Florian Dörfler](https://dorfler.ethz.ch/).
During my PhD I developed algorithms in the area of continuous-time RL, safe RL, optimistic RL, Bayesian Deep Learning, etc.  
Currently, I am Research Scientist Intern at Google DeepMind working on post-training of LLMs. 

Prior to my PhD I did Data Science Master at ETH Zürich and Mathematics Bachelor at University of Ljubljana. For my master thesis I received ETH Medal and for Bachelor thesis I received Faculty Preseren Prize. 

In my free time, I love being outdoors or getting lost in a good book.
